# ddstats-scraper
Run the .exe found at `\DdstatsScraper\ddstats-scraper.exe` and enter your player id (found by mousing over your rank on the [devildaggers.info leaderboard](https://devildaggers.info/Leaderboard) or the numbers in the url on your [ddstats](https://ddstats.com/) page).

Will not return any games or username for valid user ids if that player has never recorded a run with ddstats.
